/**
 * Shell Sort covered in https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-deep-dive-using-java
 *
 * Variation of Insertion Sort.
 * While Insertion Sort chooses which element to insert using a gap of 1,
 * Shell Sort starts out using a larger gap value and as the algorithm runs,
 * the gap is reduced. The goal is to reduce the amount of shifting required.
 *
 * The last gap value is always 1
 * A gap value of 1 equivalent to Insertion Sort
 * So, the algorithm does some preliminary work (using gap values greater than 1),
 * and then becomes Insertion Sort
 *
 * By the time we get to Insertion Sort, the array has been partially sorted,
 * so there's less shifting required.
 *
 * In-place and unstable algorithm.
 *
 * Worst case Quadratic, O(nÂ²), but it can perform much better than that
